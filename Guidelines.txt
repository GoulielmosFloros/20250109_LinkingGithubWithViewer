Development Steps

Modify the fileData interface to only contain the name as string and commits of type BUI.Dropdown.

Remove the matchingCommits array from the component.

Modify the filesList array from the component. Instead of filtering a specific file, filter all files that end with .ifc.

Modify the getFile function to receive a new argument called commitSha of type string. In the request of the same function the ref should receive this new argument.

In the getCommits function, get rid of the whole for that iterates the commits. Create a new for loop that iterates the index and file from the filesList array entries. Check if the file exists or else continue.

Create a bim-dropdown element called commitsDrop. Set vertical and required attributes to true.

Create an event listener on change that removes the menus using BUI.ContextMenu.removeMenus() and retrieve the file with the dropdown values via getFile.

Create a for loop to iterate through the commits.data.

Do a request using octokit to get the commit’s data using the SHA to this endpoint: "GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref}”, assign it to a constant called commitsData.

Map the commits.data.files to a constant commitFiles to get the names of the files associated to that commit. Check if there’s data in the array or continue.

If the array contains the file in turn, create a bim-option. The label attribute is the commitData.data.commit.message and the value is an object of the format { file, sha: commit.sha }. Append the option to the commitsDrop.

Outside of the commits for loop, do file.commits = commitsDrop.

Reassing the file object to the filesList array using the index.

In the user-interface file, remove the onGetFileClick function.

In the BUI.html return of the stateful component, instead of mapping the matching commits array, map through the filesList.

Replace the inner BUI.html return with this:

`
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <bim-label style="flex-grow: 2;">${file.name}</bim-label>
  <div style="max-width: 200px;">${file.commits}</div>
</div>
